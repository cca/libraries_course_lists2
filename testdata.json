Students will learn how to design and implement hybrid art systems that can use computers or circuits to interface with sensors, motors, video, sound, pneumatics and lights. Basic skills include: electronics, mechanical engineering, metal fabrication, fabrication and design strategies, computer programming (with object-based applications) and control of media. Field trips to military/industrial salvage yards and artist studios and visits from artists will augment technical instruction, lab time and theoretical discourse. Topics include: the nature of interfaces, narration in random access environments, the poetic potential in electromechanical devices, interactivity and isolation, and integrating time-based mediums such as video and audio into sculptural environments and objects.",

Whether you are a designer, artist, or filmmaker, what inspires you to create art and design are the pre-visual concepts that arise in your mind. These pre-visualized concepts may potentially become the foundation of a great painting, product, movie, or advertisement. In this course, students learn how to form and evolve ideas through the use of images, as well as to communicate them clearly and effectively with clients, art directors, or in meetings, using sketch techniques. Class time will be divided between demos, short lectures, and in class studio time. Students should expect to have at least a few hours of homework each week. Students begin by learning the fundamentals of translating 3D space and objects onto 2D drawn space. Topics covered include using 1, 2, and 3 point perspective, laying out your ideas, using backgrounds, and finding your style. Various types of notation (arrows, typography) will be explored to help clarify your drawn ideas. *Bring to first class: 14\" x 17' pad of layout paper, pad of tracing paper, a variety of drawing pencils (2H, HB, 2B), fine-point ballpoint pen or sharpie.*",
