"""
Given a course and a list of taxonomies, create the taxonomy terms in VAULT and
for the hierarchical course list terms store the term/its UUID under the "terms"
list of the taxonomy in memory (to aid with adding further terms later). Each
course creates both program-level and syllabus collection terms for:

- overall hierarchical course list taxonomy
- course title
- course "name" e.g. course code without section digits
- course section
- faculty names

For instance, CERAM-101-01 might look like:
taxos = [
    {
        "uuid": "0dc4bdac-1215-44f1-945d-3e67ed4c36ff",
        "name": "CERAM - COURSE LIST",
        "terms": [ { "term": "Summer 2019", "uuid": "1" },
        { "term": "Intro to Ceramics", "uuid": "5" },
        ... ]
    },
    {
        "uuid": "0dc4bdac-1215-44f1-945d-3e67ed4c36ff",
        "name": "CERAM - course sections",
        "terms": [ { "term": 'CERAM-101-01', "uuid": "2" },
        { "term": 'CERAM-301-07', "uuid": "7" } ]
    },
    {
        "uuid": "0dc4bdac-1215-44f1-945d-3e67ed4c36ff",
        "name": "CERAM - course names",
        "terms": [ { "term": 'CERAM-101', "uuid": "3" } ]
    },
    (a few more of these)...
    {
        "uuid": "0dc4bdac-1215-44f1-945d-3e67ed4c36ff",
        "name": "SYLLABUS - COURSE LIST",
        "terms": [ { "term": "Summer 2019", "uuid": "1" },
        { "term": "Intro to Ceramics", "uuid": "5" },
        ... ]
    }
]

Note that we only record the "terms" list for course list taxonomies in memory,
there's not as much value in storing the terms from flat taxonomies.

We have some special logic in here for non-standard taxonomies, such as Archt
(which has one division-level set of lists for 3 programs) and Syllabus course
lists.
